#Coding-guidelines

Our goal is to build stable and reliable systems. 

In the real world, good coding is not about writing fancy code, but rather about creating stable and easy to maintain applications.

Simple code 

**1 -   The code must be - SIMPLE !**

	Questions that I need to ask myself when I read the code: 

	1 - Am I sure there isn't a simpler approach to get the task done?

	2 - Can I spot a complicated section in my code?
      ( maybe it is a sign that things are not in the simplest way).

    3- Can I explain in simple words what every block of code does ? 
	If it is too complicated to explain, then maybe it can be dan in a simpler way

Names

** 2 - Names are the most important thing in the system:**

A - All name must be meaningful 

All mean: variables, files, class, functions - ALL, with no exception


Examples: 

|  type | Bad  | Good  |
|---|---|---|
| File name  | index.blade.php  | agent_index.blade.php  |
|  File name 2 | AveragePositionController  | AgentAveragePositionController  |
